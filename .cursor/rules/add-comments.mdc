# Code Generation Guidelines

1.  **Add Explanatory Comments**: For any non-obvious block of JSX or JavaScript logic, add a comment explaining its purpose.
2.  **Explain Props**: For each component, add comments explaining what each prop is for.
3.  **Document State Variables**: When initializing state with `useState`, add a comment to explain what the state variable tracks.
